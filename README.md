# THE NIGHT OF THE STAG

This is a short (about 15 min) narrative adventure about the life cycle of the stag beetle (Lucanus cervus).

Inspired by Hollow Knight and Ori, the team wanted to create something magical with the limited resources we were given, bearing in mind the academic scope of the project.
